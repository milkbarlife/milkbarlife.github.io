## Flint's Dimples Cupcakes
### $4.20/ea

[![Flint's Dimples Photo](/assets/images/menu/flints-dimples-preview.jpg)](/assets/menu/flints-dimples.jpg) Behold! Flint's Dimples! I, Mr. Michael, the owner of this fine Milk Bar, personally guarantee that these luscious cupcakes are smoother and softer than any cupcakes you've possibly eaten before. Made by our Ultra Talented Personal Professional Baker (tm), Stephanie, these little puppies are chock full of hand-mashed bananas, mixed to fluffy perfection by the finest of KitchenAid stand mixers. A flavor journey awaits you! Take a bite and be transported to a banana paradise which fades to a silky chocolate wonderland. Wash that down with a glass of My Finest 2% (tm) just as the salty aftertaste begins to grace your palate. I've been told I should sell these for 16.4285714286 times the current list price, but I am a man of the people. A man of business, yes, but a man who also knows that the world needs Flint's Dimples! Come on in and enjoy!
