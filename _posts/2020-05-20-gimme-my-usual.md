This is my bar. Well, not really. It's Michael's bar, but I'm here, in this chair two from the far left, very often. Like, every day. What can I say? I'm a fan of milk. And Michael is always willing to lend an ear when work's got me troubled. Well, not actually lend me his ear. I asked once.

"That's a fine ear you've got," I said. "Would make a potent potion ingredient for warding off witches. How much?"

"Not for sale," was Michael's reply. Love that guy.

Anywho, being a regular patron and all, I know all the usual clientele. I get along with most of 'em most of the time. Don't see many new faces. Today of all days, some new guy shows up. This guy walks in jingling around like he's made of money. Like he's full to the brim with it. Sounds like metal on porcelain. He's got that look in his eye that makes it seem like he thinks he's better than everyone else. Maybe that's just me wanting all his jingly stuff. Whatever. He sits down three chairs to my right.

"I'll have a strawberry milk, please," I think I hear him tell the barkeep. He's got a quieter voice than I'd expected. Suddenly the guy's eyes are boring a hole straight through mine. I jolt a bit and quickly look down into my glass of choco-nutty milk. I guess I was staring. Whoops. Bad form for a Witch Hunter. Bar gets quiet for a long second and then I hear it. The sound of a coin on the bar top. I sneak a peek out of the corner of my eye. Sure enough, but new guy has slapped a super shiny, gold coin on the counter. He slides it toward the barkeep and mumbles something.

"The jingly guy's barely touched his drink. Why'd he order another?" I wonder to myself as I look back at my glass. Next thing I know, Michael's sliding a fresh choco-nutty (double chocolate) in front of me.

"Compliments of Jeremiah," he says in his usual, gruff, barkeep voice.

Huh. Maybe this Jeremiah guy ain't that bad.
