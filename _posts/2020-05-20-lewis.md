They sometimes just want to be left alone.

This is my bar. Well, not really. It's Michael's bar, but I'm here, in this char two from the far left, very often. Like, every day. What can I say? I'm a fan of milk. And Michael is always willing to lend an ear when work's got me troubled. Well, not actually lend me his ear. I asked once.

"That's a fine ear you've got," I said. "Would make a potent potion ingredient for warding off witches. How much?"

"Not for sale," was Michael's reply. Love that guy.

Anywho, being a regular patron and all, I know all the usual clientele.
