"Bar's pretty busy these days," says Michael as he slides me a glass a little too emphatically. I catch it but some milk sloshes over the edge onto the bar. "It's good that the bar's got business. Business is good for milk and milk is good for people. Milk's got power, ya know."

I glance up at him from my glass with a mixture of curiosity and surprise.

"Heh. I see that look in your eye. No. Not that kind of power. You've been talking to Lewis, haven't you?" Michael smirks and wipes up the spill as he continues. "Milk does the heart good. Goes well with just about anything. You ever had milk right after a warm donut? Look me in the eye and tell me that isn't magical."

I try to remember the last time I had donuts. It's been far too long. What do donuts taste like? It's a vague memory. Like something out of a sugar-induced dream. Michael's voice yanks me back to reality.

"You know what, I'm getting ahead of myself," the barkeep says as he throws his rag over his shoulder and leans on the counter. "You weren't in here earlier, but you missed a pretty touching moment. There's nothing like a cold glass o' milk to bring friends together."

I don't think I could get out of hearing this story if I wanted to. Good thing I don't want to. I finish my glass of hazelnut milk and hand it to Mike. He turns to start refilling it. He knows me too well.

"You remember Bernard, right? Small fellow. Real smart. Kinda scruffy."

I nod. Of course I know Bernard. He's always been a good bar mate. I think he's a doctor.

"He's a funny one," says Michael as he slides me a replenished glass. It sloshes over again and he tosses the rag in my direction. "Not a fan of birthdays. But he also is. Something about not wanting to be older but liking celebrating. Doesn't make sense to me, but I don't judge."

I shrug and toss the rag back to Michael.

"Well, Bernard came in earlier. It's his birthday tomorrow so he was just taking some time for himself, you know." I smile slightly in response as I start to unwrap a straw for my fresh drink. Michael shoots me a glare. Right. Forgot he doesn't like straws. Something about "tainting the milk flavor." I put the straw down and take a swig straight from the glass.

Michael nods approvingly and continues, "He ordered his usual. A strawberry milk with a little umbrella. I made the drink and slid it to him along with a nondescript brown package.

"Michael. What's this for?" Bernard asked.

"I honestly didn't know what it was, but I'm not gonna say that!" Michael laughed jovially. His belly laugh is something to behold. Brightens my day every time. "It ain't nothin'. Just a drink upgrade," said Michael nonchalantly as he continued to polish a glass.

"Courtesy of...?

"A few patrons," he said as his eyes flicked toward a few penguins seated at the other end of the bar. I followed his gaze. The penguins, who I recognized immediately as Gregory and Melissa, raised their milk glasses slightly in my direction. Gregory raised his chin a bit at the same time.

I took a sip of my drink and opened the package. Quietly. Don't wanna draw much attention.

Inside was a brand new pair of jeans. Crisp, blue-gray denim embroidered with a small, ornate-yet-understated representation of me. My face. On a pair of jeans. The left butt cheek no less.

A single, happy tear slid down my cheek. I wiped it away quickly as I took a swig.

"That drink satisfactory?" asked Michael.

"More than," I replied.
